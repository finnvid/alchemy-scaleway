# Architecture

This package uses a flat Alchemy v2 provider structure with direct Scaleway API integrations.

## Compatibility And Toolchain

The compatibility target is `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.76`, with an Effect peer range of `>=4.0.0-rc.112 || >=4.0.0`. Development pins `effect` and all three `@effect/platform-*` packages to `4.0.0-rc.112`.

Development uses Bun `1.4.2`, TypeScript `7.0.2`, and oxfmt `0.66.0`. The Bun version is declared in `package.json#packageManager` and read by both CI and release workflows. Tooling versions are explicit, and `bun.lock` records the resolved dependency graph.

## Provider Model

Resources use Alchemy v2's `Provider.effect(...Provider.of({ read, reconcile, delete }))` model. Direct Scaleway API behavior is isolated in `Clients.ts`; resource files translate between Alchemy props/attributes and client calls.

## Resource Design Philosophy

Alchemy resources should model useful programmer workflows, not mirror cloud APIs one-to-one. AWS Lambda and Cloudflare Worker resources in Alchemy intentionally collapse multiple provider operations into one resource when that is the helpful application-facing abstraction: bundling code, creating URLs, provisioning routes/domains/triggers, waiting for stabilization, applying defaults, and returning derived outputs.

Apply the same rule to Scaleway:

- Keep direct Scaleway endpoint details in `Clients.ts`, but let resources hide provider quirks and sequencing requirements.
- Prefer intent-shaped props over raw API payloads when the higher-level shape is clearer for application authors.
- It is acceptable for one programmer-facing resource to orchestrate companion resources, such as container domains or triggers, when that matches the common deployment workflow.
- Keep standalone low-level resources available for advanced cases; ergonomic composition should not remove precise control.
- Return outputs that application code needs, such as URLs, resolved names, IDs, regions, and deployment-relevant metadata.
- Add readiness waits, retry/stabilization behavior, and safe defaults inside reconciliation instead of requiring users to script them.
- Do not add name-based adoption merely for convenience; adoption must be backed by reliable ownership markers or clearly safe provider semantics.

## Resource Conventions

- Physical names use `createPhysicalName` through `Internal.physicalName`.
- `Project` provisions Scaleway Account projects through `/account/v3/projects`; `organizationId` changes replace the project, while name and description update in place. When a stack declares exactly one `Project` and neither the resource nor provider sets `project`, new project-scoped application resources get an internal default project reference so Alchemy plans the dependency, creates the project, and creates the resources in that managed project. Existing resources with persisted `projectId` outputs keep that project for backward compatibility. `Scaleway.providers({ project })` is the explicit top-level fallback for beta stacks that should keep creating resources in an existing project.
- Remote state and DNS resources are shared-project exceptions: Object Storage state derives its default bucket from `SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`, and `DnsZone`/`DnsRecord` default to credentials unless explicitly configured with another project.
- `Bucket` defaults to retain-on-removal, stores `alchemy:logical-id` in S3 tags, and returns `Unowned(attrs)` for foreign buckets found by name. An optional `project` scopes S3 requests by signing with `ACCESS_KEY@project-id`; without it the API key's preferred project is used, preserving pre-`project` behavior.
- `Instance` tags servers with `alchemy:logical-id` and a per-generation `alchemy:instance-id`. When a create is interrupted after the server exists but before attributes persist, the retry recovers the server by matching the same `alchemy:instance-id` tag; replacements mint a new instance id, so pre-replacement servers are never adopted. On clean-state creates with desired public IPs, reconcile checks live IP attachment and fails before create when any desired public IP is attached to another server. That guard is intentionally skipped when persisted `serverId` state or same-generation recovery identifies the server, so ordinary updates, interrupted-create recovery, and delete-first replacements can detach/reassign the IP in the correct lifecycle order. This is a behavioral breaking change only for clean-state callers that intentionally relied on implicit attached-public-IP transfer; existing serialized `.alchemy` state requires no migration because props, attributes, and state shape are unchanged. Instance reconcile also retries 403 `insufficient permissions` with bounded backoff to absorb IAM propagation after a fresh `Project` create.
- Containers and namespaces are read by persisted IDs only. Scaleway's Containers API does not expose a reliable ownership tag surface, so name-based adoption is intentionally avoided for those resources.
- Deletes are idempotent and ignore 404 responses.
- Container, trigger, and domain readiness waits use Effect sleeps inside provider reconciliation.
- `Container` may orchestrate custom domains and cron triggers from `domains`/`crons` props for the common service deployment workflow. Standalone `Domain` and `Trigger` resources remain available for explicit control.
- Serverless Functions use the separate `/functions/v1beta1` API. `Function` accepts either a prebuilt ZIP path or a local `main` entrypoint. The bundled path uses Alchemy's public bundler and a deterministic ZIP before uploading through Scaleway's signed upload URL. `Function` may also orchestrate custom domains and cron triggers from `domains`/`crons` props; standalone `FunctionDomain` and `FunctionCron` resources remain available for explicit control.
- Stable references and ordering: under Alchemy beta.59, a whole-resource reference to an upstream that is being updated in place is materialized into that upstream's `stables` values at plan time, and the scheduler derives wait edges from the resolved props. A downstream that consumes only stable attributes is therefore allowed to run concurrently with the upstream's update. That is correct for pure data dependencies (e.g. `DnsRecord` reading a parent's stable `url`), but it breaks ordering-only relationships where the cloud API serializes the child against the parent's own update. Scaleway rejects a function/container config change while one of its custom domains is mid-create (`domain ... is in blocking state: pending`). To express the real relationship, standalone `Domain`/`FunctionDomain` anchor on the parent's non-stable `status` output via `parentReadiness` (`Internal.ts`): because `status` is not in the parent's `stables`, the whole-resource reference cannot collapse to plain values, so the upstream edge survives and the child waits for the parent's reconcile. The provider lifecycle still extracts the stable `containerId`/`functionId` for the API call; the readiness anchor is scheduling-only. `Container` exposes a non-stable `status` attribute for this purpose.
- `DnsZone` is a DNS zone handle. It discovers existing apex or child zones by zone name, returns the live DNS authority `projectId` for downstream records, and only creates an absent child zone in the requested DNS project. Discovery is conservative when a same-name zone is visible in multiple projects: callers must pass the authority project explicitly instead of relying on arbitrary API ordering. Existing zones have no ownership marker, so discovered zones are safe references (`managed: false`) and are retained even if a stack later uses `destroy()`; zones created by Alchemy return `managed: true` and may be deleted when destruction is explicit.
- `DnsRecord` owns one complete record set for a zone/name/type, using Scaleway's record `set` operation for convergent upserts. When passed a `DnsZone` resource it carries the zone authority project into DNS record operations, which supports shared DNS projects pointing at resources in separate application projects. Cold creation refuses to replace existing record sets unless `takeoverExisting` is explicit (`overwriteExisting` remains a deprecated alias). Outputs persist whether the record set was `created` or `taken-over`; taken-over records are retained on destroy unless `deleteTakenOver` is explicit, while legacy outputs without ownership keep the old delete behavior for compatibility. Persisted DNS project identity is used for reads/deletes and project changes are rejected instead of deleting in one DNS project and writing another.
- `RegistryNamespace` provisions the Container Registry namespace needed to host images consumed by `Container.image`. `ContainerImage` can build a local Docker context, log in to that registry with Scaleway credentials, push the tag, and return `ref` for `Container.image`; external CI remains optional for teams that prefer prebuilt images.
- `ContainerImage` hashes Docker context contents during diff so source changes trigger rebuilds without changing props. Its `ref` uses a content-derived tag so dependent `Container` resources redeploy when source changes even if the requested tag is unchanged; it also pushes `stableRef` with the requested tag. The hash applies `.dockerignore` rules before traversal and hashes symlink metadata with `lstat`/`readlink` instead of following targets, so ignored files and broken symlinks behave like Docker context inputs rather than pre-build failures. Builds default to `linux/amd64` because Scaleway Serverless Containers reject arm64 images. It intentionally shells out to the local Docker CLI rather than embedding a Docker client. Scaleway Registry pushes use Scaleway credentials by default; external registries such as GHCR or Docker Hub require explicit `auth` or an existing Docker login. `Container` still accepts public external image refs directly, but Scaleway's Containers API does not expose private external registry pull credentials.
- `ContainerImageMirror` copies an already-published remote image into a Scaleway Container Registry namespace so Serverless Containers can deploy images whose canonical source is a private external registry. Unlike `ContainerImage`, it has **no external binary dependency**: `RegistryClient.ts` implements the Docker/OCI Registry v2 distribution protocol directly (Bearer-token auth challenge/response, manifest fetch, blob upload state machine, manifest push), so there is no skopeo/crane and no Docker daemon. It preserves multi-arch manifest lists by copying every referenced child manifest (including attestation manifests) before pushing the index, and copies by digest. `diff` resolves the mirrored source digest it will actually publish — full indexes keep the top-manifest digest, while `allPlatforms: false` uses the selected platform manifest digest — so moving source tags re-copy convergently without drifting after a successful mirror; `reconcile` pushes both a content-derived `ref` and a requested-tag `stableRef`, mirroring `ContainerImage` output shape. Before copying an image tree, reconcile checks whether the destination content manifest already exists and skips blob/manifest uploads when it does, while still retagging the requested stable tag for convergence after interrupted deploys. Reconcile emits progress notes for manifest/blob/tag steps and can apply a per-operation abortable `timeout` to digest resolution and copying. Scaleway destinations authenticate with `nologin:SCW_SECRET_KEY`; private sources and non-Scaleway destinations accept explicit `sourceAuth`/`auth`. The copy engine is injectable behind `ContainerImageMirrorEngine` (`setContainerImageMirrorEngine`) so resource lifecycle tests run without network, while `RegistryClient` is covered directly against an in-process mock registry and a gated live Scaleway smoke test (`smoke:scaleway:registry-copy`). Current limitations: blobs are copied sequentially and buffered in memory with a known Content-Length monolithic upload (validated against Scaleway), so very large single layers are held in memory; chunked-streaming uploads are a future optimization. Mirrored images are retained on delete; registry cleanup is left to `RegistryNamespace`.
- `Container` accepts an optional `imageDigest` input persisted as an attribute and compared in `diff`/`reconcile`. It is the Alchemy-side analogue of Terraform's `registry_sha256`: wiring `imageDigest: mirror.digest` (or `ContainerImage.digest`) forces a redeploy when a moving tag points at new content even though the `image` string is unchanged. It is not derived from the Containers API, so `read` preserves the persisted value. `Container.timeout` maps to Scaleway's runtime request timeout, not provider readiness waiting; create/update polling waits until `ready` or error/failed and emits elapsed-time progress notes.
- `Secret` provisions Secret Manager metadata and current value versions. Secret values use `Redacted<string>` and are never returned in resource attributes.
- `DatabaseInstance` provisions Scaleway Managed Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL instances through `/rdb/v1/regions/{region}/instances`. It is the database server primitive: initial admin credentials are required as `Redacted<string>` input and are never returned; logical databases, users, privileges, ACLs, and higher-level connection helpers should remain separate resources or future convenience composition. It defaults to retain-on-removal and uses `alchemy:logical-id` tags for rediscovery. Project, engine, node, user, password, HA, and volume identity changes are conservative replacements, while name, tags, and backup schedule reconcile in place.
- `Vpc` provisions Scaleway VPCs and can enable routing and custom route propagation. Both are one-way provider operations; attempting to disable an already-enabled flag fails locally.
- `PrivateNetwork` provisions Scaleway Private Networks, optional VPC attachment, subnet membership, DHCP enablement, and default route propagation. VPC and project changes replace the resource.
- `VpcAcl` owns the complete ACL rule set for a single VPC and IP version. Deleting it resets that ACL set to `defaultPolicy: "accept"` and no rules; do not use multiple `VpcAcl` resources for the same VPC/IP version.
- `VpcRoute` provisions routes inside one VPC. VPC changes replace the route; destination, description, tags, and next-hop changes update it in place. Next hops can be resource IDs, Private Networks, or VPC connectors.
- `VpcConnector` provisions connectors between two VPCs. Either VPC identity changing replaces the connector; name and tags update in place.
- `Instance` provisions Scaleway Instance virtual machines. Zone, project, image, commercial type, and initial volume identity changes replace the resource; metadata, public IP attachments, security group attachment, placement group attachment, protection, and desired power state update in place.
- `InstanceKnownHosts` reads the Scaleway `ssh-host-fingerprints` user-data for an Instance or raw server ID, waits for SSH to answer, verifies the live host key handshake with the embedded SSH client scanner, compares both sets, and returns `knownHosts`/`knownHostsB64` for strict host-key checking.
- `SecurityGroup` provisions Scaleway Instance security groups and owns the complete rule set. Zone changes replace the resource; metadata and rule changes update in place.
- `FlexibleIp` provisions Scaleway Instance flexible IPs. It defaults to retain-on-removal and uses `alchemy:logical-id` tags for rediscovery. Zone or IP type changes replace the reservation; tags, reverse DNS, and explicit server attachment changes update in place. Omitted `serverId` leaves attachment unmanaged/preserved; `serverId: null` detaches.
- `PrivateNic` provisions Scaleway Instance private NICs that attach one Instance to one Private Network. Zone, server, Private Network, or IPAM IP identity changes replace the NIC; tags update in place.
- Scaleway documents Private Network subnet add/delete endpoints, and the provider uses them for subnet drift reconciliation. Live production smoke currently verifies create-time subnets only because Scaleway returns `501 unimplemented endpoint` for the documented mutation endpoints in `fr-par`.
- Current Alchemy v2 beta `ResourceOptions` do not expose an `alwaysUpdate` or equivalent read-on-noop option. Because of that, same-props deploys cannot detect external deletion of `Container`-managed companion domains/triggers or `Function`-managed companion domains/crons. The read paths verify persisted companion IDs when a read/update path runs, but no-op plans will not recover missing companions until a prop change triggers reconciliation. Revisit this if Alchemy adds an always-update/read-on-noop resource option.

## Adding A Resource

1. Add or extend the relevant client function in `Clients.ts`.
2. Add a flat `src/MyResource.ts` file with props, attributes, `Resource`, and provider.
3. Register the resource and provider in `Providers.ts`.
4. Re-export from `src/index.ts`.
5. Add README documentation and a focused test for pure behavior.
