# Changelog

All notable changes to `@bjorntech/alchemy-scaleway` are documented here. The package follows the alchemy beta line — see [README › Compatibility](./README.md#compatibility).

## Unreleased

## [0.7.20-beta.76] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- Updated compatibility target to `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.76` and raised the Effect peer minimum to `>=4.0.0-rc.112`, matching Alchemy's requirement. Development pins remain on Effect rc.112 and matching `@effect/platform-*` packages.
- Updated development tooling to TypeScript `7.0.2`, oxfmt `0.66.0`, `@types/bun` `1.4.1`, and `@types/ssh2` `1.15.6`; replaced floating `latest` development dependencies with explicit versions.
- Pinned Bun to `1.4.2` in `package.json#packageManager` and aligned CI and release workflows with that version.

## [0.7.19-beta.74] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Updated compatibility target to `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.74` and Effect `>=4.0.0-rc.110`, with development pins on Effect rc.112 and matching `@effect/platform-*` rc.112 packages.

## [0.7.18-beta.72] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- `ContainerImageMirror({ allPlatforms: false })` now defaults source digest resolution to `linux/amd64`, so multi-arch sources mirror cleanly without the `source has no linux/amd64 manifest` regression and keep the selected-platform no-op/update behavior.

## [0.7.17-beta.72] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- `ContainerImageMirror` now resolves and persists the digest that it actually mirrors: full multi-arch copies keep the source index digest, while `allPlatforms: false` mirrors use the selected platform manifest digest. This keeps repeat plans noop after a successful mirror and still updates when the selected platform image changes.

## [0.7.16-beta.72] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Updated compatibility target to `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.72` and Effect `>=4.0.0-beta.100`, with development pins on Effect beta.107 and matching `@effect/platform-*` beta.107 packages.

### Added

- `InstanceKnownHosts` verifies Scaleway Instance SSH host fingerprints against the live SSH handshake scanner and returns strict `knownHosts` / `knownHostsB64` output for SSH clients without shelling out to `ssh-keyscan`.

### Fixed

- `ScalewayError` now uses Effect beta.107's `Schema.TaggedError` constructor pattern, preserving `_tag`, constructor usability, typed error channels, and `catchTag` / `catchTags` matching while avoiding the removed `Schema.TaggedErrorClass` API.

## [0.7.15-beta.67] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- `Instance` no longer detaches and moves any already-attached desired public IP
  during a clean-state create. If the desired public IP is live on
  another server and no Instance state or per-generation recovery tag identifies
  the managed server, reconciliation now fails with an import/restore/detach
  diagnostic before creating a duplicate VM (#118).
- Narrow behavioral breaking change: clean-state `Instance` creates no longer
  implicitly transfer an attached desired public IP from another server. Existing
  serialized `.alchemy` state remains compatible with no migration because
  `Instance` props, attributes, and state shape do not change. Persisted-state
  updates, interrupted-create recovery, and delete-first replacements with public
  IPs remain supported; the guard runs only when neither a persisted `serverId`
  nor matching generation recovery identifies the Instance.
- Escaped historical Effect peer range pipes in Markdown code spans in the
  README compatibility table so parsers keep the release notes in the Notes
  column.

## [0.7.14-beta.67] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Updated compatibility target to `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.67` and Effect
  `>=4.0.0-beta.100`, with development pins on Effect beta.103 and matching
  `@effect/platform-*` beta.103 packages.

## [0.7.13-beta.62] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- `DnsRecord` now separates explicit cold-state takeover from ordinary updates
  with `takeoverExisting`; `overwriteExisting` remains a deprecated alias.
  Newly taken-over record sets are retained on destroy unless
  `deleteTakenOver: true` is set, while legacy outputs without ownership keep
  the previous delete behavior for compatibility.
- `DnsZone` discovery now fails when the same zone name is visible in multiple
  projects unless the DNS authority project is explicit, avoiding arbitrary
  cross-project selection.
- Removed the legacy `alchemy-effect` package keyword after the repository
  migration to Alchemy v2.

## [0.7.12-beta.62] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- `FlexibleIp` now treats omitted `serverId` as unmanaged/preserved instead of
  detaching during unrelated updates; use `serverId: null` to explicitly detach.

## [0.7.11-beta.62] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Updated compatibility target to `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.62` and Effect `>=4.0.0-beta.98`.
- Updated direct provider lifecycle test calls for Alchemy beta.62's required `fqn` request field.

## [0.7.10-beta.59] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- `Container` create retries that hit a same-name Scaleway `resource already
  exists` conflict now report the exact live container ID when it can be listed,
  instead of only surfacing the generic API conflict.
- `ContainerImage.dockerfile` now resolves relative to `context` when no
  cwd-relative file exists, while preserving existing cwd-relative behavior for
  stacks that already rely on it.

## [0.7.9-beta.59] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- `Bucket` now accepts a `project` prop (including the single managed `Project`
  default) by signing S3 requests with Scaleway's documented
  `ACCESS_KEY@project-id` access-key override. Buckets without an explicit or
  persisted project keep using the API key's preferred project, preserving
  existing behavior. Changing `project` forces a replacement.

### Fixed

- `Instance` no longer leaks an orphan server when a create is interrupted
  after the Scaleway server exists but before Alchemy persists its ID. Servers
  are tagged with a per-generation `alchemy:instance-id`, and the retry
  recovers the matching server instead of creating a duplicate; replacements
  mint a new generation tag, so pre-replacement servers are never adopted.
- `Instance` reconcile now retries 403 `insufficient permissions` errors with
  bounded backoff, absorbing IAM propagation delays right after a managed
  `Project` is created.

## [0.7.8-beta.59] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- `ContainerImageMirror` now verifies destination tags through pull-scope
  registry reads after tagging, so dependent `Container` updates are less likely
  to race Scaleway Registry tag visibility. `Container` readiness also treats
  Scaleway's transient "Unable to pull container image" error as retryable for a
  bounded window before surfacing a deployment failure.

## [0.7.7-beta.59] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- `ContainerImageMirror` now skips retagging destination tags that already point
  at the desired digest. This avoids hanging on redundant Scaleway Registry tag
  `PUT` requests during retries after an interrupted deploy already copied and
  tagged the image.

## [0.7.6-beta.59] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- `ContainerDeployFailed` now includes a readable fallback message when Scaleway
  marks a container deployment `error`/`failed` without returning
  `error_message`, instead of rendering as a blank tagged error. Container
  readiness polling also includes the container ID and elapsed wait time in
  progress notes so long Scaleway rollouts remain visibly active.
- `ContainerImageMirror` now skips copying an image tree when the destination
  content manifest already exists, while still retagging the requested stable
  tag. This avoids re-uploading blobs/manifests on retries where a previous
  failed deploy copied the image into Scaleway Registry but Alchemy did not
  commit the mirror output state.

## [0.7.5-beta.59] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- `ContainerImageMirror` now emits progress notes while resolving and copying
  registry manifests/blobs, and accepts a per-mirror `timeout` budget that is
  applied independently to digest resolution and copy operations.

## [0.7.4-beta.59] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- `Container` no longer treats the presence of a `public_endpoint` as readiness.
  Scaleway populates the endpoint early during deployment, so the old check
  returned as soon as a URL existed and let companions (custom domains, cron
  triggers) be created against a container that was still `deploying` — which
  Scaleway then rejects. A container must now reach `status: "ready"` before
  companions proceed.
- `Container` deployments that enter `error`/`failed` now fail fast as
  `Scaleway.ContainerDeployFailed` (including the Scaleway `error_message`)
  instead of polling indefinitely, and a persisted container left in an error
  state is redeployed on the next reconcile rather than treated as settled.

## [0.7.3-beta.59] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- `Domain` custom-domain creation now waits for the CNAME to be visible through
  public recursive resolvers (`1.1.1.1`, `8.8.8.8`) and requires every public
  resolver to agree before creating or recreating the Scaleway Serverless custom
  domain. Previously readiness also queried Scaleway authoritative nameservers
  (`ns0`/`ns1.dom.scw.cloud`) and treated the record as ready if any resolver
  returned the target. Scaleway's custom-domain validation behaves like an
  external validator that needs the hostname to resolve through public DNS, so
  the authoritative-only match let the domain be created before public
  propagation completed, causing repeated transient deployment errors. The
  provider also re-checks public DNS before each retry after a transient domain
  deployment error.

## [0.7.2-beta.59] - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- Updated compatibility target to `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.59` and Effect `>=4.0.0-beta.84`.
- Migrated the provider to the beta.59 client service shape: an injectable
  `ScalewayClients` Context service plus `ScalewayClientsLive` layer, provided
  once in `Scaleway.providers()`, instead of leaking credential/client
  requirements through resource lifecycle effects.
- Marked durable, in-place-stable outputs as `stables` so downstream consumers
  resolve them during an upstream update: container/function service URLs
  (`url`, `publicEndpoint`, `domainName`) and registry endpoints
  (`endpoint`, `imagePrefix`). `ContainerImage`/`ContainerImageMirror` expose
  their image refs/digests as stables with dynamic update-time `diff.stables`.

### Fixed

- `Container` and `Function` custom domains (`Domain`, `FunctionDomain`) now wait
  for their parent's reconcile to finish before creating the domain. Under
  beta.59, a whole-resource reference to an updating parent is materialized to
  its stable attributes, which dropped the scheduling edge and let the domain be
  created while the parent was mid-update — Scaleway then rejects the parent's
  config change with `domain ... is in blocking state: pending`. The domain
  resources now anchor on the parent's non-stable `status` output, preserving a
  real Alchemy upstream edge. `Container` exposes a `status` attribute for this.
- `Instance` updates now power the server on before waiting for flexible/public
  IP attachment to converge, instead of waiting on a stopped server forever.
- `DnsRecord` and `Domain` tolerate stable-materialized parent references whose
  optional address fields are present-but-undefined.

## [0.7.1-beta.51] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- The npm package scope and repository metadata now use `@bjorntech/alchemy-scaleway`.
- Live smoke tests now require DNS zones from environment variables instead of
  using checked-in domain defaults.

## [0.7.0-beta.51] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- `ContainerImageMirror` copies an existing remote image (such as a private
  `ghcr.io` image) into a Scaleway Container Registry namespace using a built-in
  pure-TypeScript Docker/OCI Registry v2 client — **no external binary** (no
  skopeo/crane) and no Docker daemon. It preserves multi-arch manifest lists,
  resolves the source digest, pushes a content-derived `ref` plus a requested-tag
  `stableRef`, and exposes `ref`/`stableRef`/`digest` for use with
  `Container.image`. This satisfies Scaleway's "registry must be Scaleway or
  public" constraint without making the source image public or rebuilding it at
  deploy time (#78).
- `Container` now accepts an optional `imageDigest` prop (and exposes it as an
  attribute). Wiring `imageDigest: mirror.digest` (or `ContainerImage.digest`)
  forces a redeploy when a moving tag such as `latest` points at new content,
  even when the `image` string is unchanged (#78).

## [0.6.4-beta.51] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- `ContainerImage` now retries transient Docker registry failures for both
  `docker login` and `docker push`, including 5xx, timeout, connection, and EOF
  failures (#75).

## [0.6.3-beta.51] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- `ContainerImage` now queues Docker pushes per registry host and cleans up its
  Docker login lock reliably, avoiding concurrent same-registry push/login
  interactions after retrying transient Docker daemon auth failures (#70).

## [0.6.2-beta.51] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- `ContainerImage` now retries transient Docker daemon 500 errors from
  `docker login`, making parallel multi-image deploys more reliable (#70).

## [0.6.1-beta.51] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- `DnsZone` now discovers existing DNS zones by zone name across accessible
  projects, so shared/default-project zones can be referenced even when app
  resources live in a managed project. Referenced zones are retained even if a
  stack later uses `destroy()`, while zones created by Alchemy remain deletable.
- Added an isolated `smoke:scaleway:dns` live smoke test for shared DNS zones
  that does not run the full production smoke stack.

## [0.6.0-beta.51] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- `Function.source` now accepts `{ main }` to bundle a Node ESM entrypoint into a
  deterministic ZIP before upload, giving Functions a Worker-style source path
  while preserving prebuilt ZIP deploys.
- `Function` can now manage custom `domains` and scheduled `crons` directly from
  its props, while standalone `FunctionDomain` and `FunctionCron` remain
  available for explicit control.
- Production smoke coverage now deploys the Function through the bundled
  `{ main }` source path and reconciles a Function-managed cron.

### Fixed

- `Function` destroy now waits until Scaleway stops returning the deleted Function,
  avoiding project deletion races against asynchronous Function cleanup.

## [0.5.1-beta.51] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- `Instance` replacement recovery now checks live Flexible IP attachment before
  replacement create, allowing stacks already stuck in a persisted create-first
  `replacing` transaction to detach the reused IP and continue (#53).

## [0.5.0-beta.51] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added initial Scaleway Serverless Functions resources: `FunctionNamespace`,
  `Function`, `FunctionCron`, and `FunctionDomain`. `Function` deploys a
  prebuilt ZIP through Scaleway upload URLs, stores a source hash, and skips
  upload/deploy on unchanged ZIP contents.

### Fixed

- Production smoke tests now skip Secret Manager coverage by default. Set
  `SCW_SMOKE_SECRETS=1` only when explicitly testing secrets, avoiding smoke
  projects left behind by Scaleway's scheduled secret-deletion retention.
- `Secret` destroy now permanently deletes all secret versions before deleting the
  secret container, so removing `retain()` and destroying a stack deletes the
  recoverable secret material as far as Scaleway's API allows.
- `Instance` replacements with attached managed `publicIps` now delete the old
  server first and defensively detach reused Flexible IPs before replacement
  create, avoiding Scaleway `precondition is not respected` failures (#53).

## [0.4.4-beta.51] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- `Project`, `FlexibleIp`, and `DatabaseInstance` now recover retained
  managed-project resources after destroy/redeploy without deleting or
  recreating the project.
- `Domain` now rediscovers existing custom domains by container and hostname when
  recovering from partial creates that persisted no `domainId`, avoiding repeated
  `resource already exists` failures.

## [0.4.3-beta.51] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- `Domain` now waits for a failed transient custom-domain deployment to be fully
  deleted before retrying the same hostname, avoiding `resource already exists`
  failures during recovery.
- `ContainerImage` now serializes and reuses Docker login per registry/user in a
  process, avoiding concurrent macOS keychain duplicate-item failures when a
  stack builds multiple images for the same registry.

## [0.4.2-beta.51] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- `DatabaseInstance` deletion now waits for both direct Scaleway RDB reads and
  project/name listing to stop returning the instance before reporting
  successful deletion, avoiding local state removal while the database can still
  block project cleanup.

## [0.4.1-beta.51] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- Production smoke tests now skip billed VPC connector/VPC Peering coverage by
  default. Set `SCW_SMOKE_EXPENSIVE_NETWORK=1` to include that path explicitly.
- Production smoke tests now include a disposable child `DnsZone` so live coverage
  exercises DNS zone creation without adopting the shared apex zone.

### Fixed

- `ContainerImage` source hashing now applies `.dockerignore` rules and hashes
  symlink metadata without following broken targets, avoiding pre-build failures
  for Docker contexts that Docker itself can handle.
- `DnsRecord` destroy/read now treats incomplete failed-create state as absent
  when required zone props were never persisted, avoiding cleanup planning
  crashes after partial failures.
- `DnsZone` no longer attempts to create apex DNS zones with an empty
  `subdomain`. Apex zones are now existing-zone references with a clear error
  when the domain is not registered or validated in Scaleway; child zones remain
  creatable with `subdomain`.

## [0.4.0-beta.51] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- `Bucket`, `DatabaseInstance`, and `FlexibleIp` now default to Alchemy's
  `retain()` removal policy to reduce accidental data or address loss. Use
  `.pipe(destroy())` when a stack should delete these resources on removal.

### Added

- Added `ContainerImage`, a local Docker build/push resource for Scaleway
  Container Registry. It returns a content-tagged pushed image `ref` plus a
  requested-tag `stableRef`, supports `buildArgs`, and can be passed directly
  to `Container.image` as `image.ref` so same-tag source changes redeploy
  dependent containers. Docker builds default to `linux/amd64` for Scaleway
  Serverless Containers compatibility.
- Added `dockerHubImage`, `ghcrImage`, and `externalImage` helpers for public
  external container image references, and optional `ContainerImage.auth` for
  pushing built images to external registries without changing the Scaleway
  Registry workflow.
- Retained `Bucket`, `DatabaseInstance`, and `FlexibleIp` resources can be
  rediscovered on later deploys when their explicit name or ownership tags still
  match. Existing same-name `Project` resources are reported as unowned and
  require explicit `adopt()`/`--adopt` before Alchemy manages them.

## [0.3.1-beta.51] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added `DatabaseInstance` for Scaleway Managed Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL
  instance lifecycle, with project defaults, readiness polling, endpoint outputs,
  and redacted admin password input.
- Added `DatabaseInstance` coverage to the production Scaleway smoke test.

### Fixed

- Scaleway readiness and transient delete waits now keep polling with progress
  notes for long-running API states instead of failing on fixed attempt counts.
- Custom domain DNS resolution waits now keep polling with progress notes before
  creating the Scaleway domain, while destructive custom-domain recreate retries
  remain bounded.

## [0.2.0-beta.51] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added `Scaleway.state()` / `Scaleway.objectStorageState()` for Alchemy v2
  remote state persisted in Scaleway Object Storage, including a project-derived
  default bucket name that is created on first use when missing.
- Added `Project` for explicit Scaleway Account project lifecycle management.
- New project-scoped application resources now default to the stack's single
  managed `Project` when present, while existing resources remain on their
  persisted project for backward compatibility. DNS and state continue to
  default to `SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID` unless configured otherwise.
- Project-scoped resource inputs use `project` for either a project ID string or
  a managed `Project` resource; resource outputs continue to expose `projectId`.

### Breaking

- New project-scoped application resources now use the stack's single managed
  `Scaleway.Project` when neither the resource nor `Scaleway.providers({ project })`
  sets a project. In that case, deploying the stack creates the managed project
  and then creates those resources in it. Existing beta stacks that should keep
  creating resources in `SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID` must configure
  `Scaleway.providers({ project: process.env.SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID })`.

### Fixed

- `DnsRecord` initial creation now refuses to replace an existing unmanaged
  same-name/type record set unless `overwriteExisting: true` is set.

## [0.1.5-beta.51] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added `DnsZone` and `DnsRecord` resources for Scaleway Domains and DNS.
  `DnsRecord` can manage explicit record values or infer records from existing
  resources such as `Container`, `FlexibleIp`, `Instance`, `RegistryNamespace`,
  and `Bucket`.
- Extended the production smoke test to create a DNS record under the configured
  smoke DNS zone, attach it as a container custom domain, and fetch
  the live URL.
- Added an opt-in live negative smoke test for `FlexibleIp` reverse-DNS create
  failures. It verifies failed initial reverse updates do not leave tagged IPs
  behind and deletes any leaked IPs before failing.
- Added `Domain.waitForCname` to wait for CNAME visibility before creating a
  Scaleway container custom domain.

### Fixed

- `Instance` now deletes all persisted Alchemy-created Block Storage volume IDs,
  including detached volumes no longer present in the server's volume map, and
  normalizes legacy region-shaped zone state before Instance API calls.
- `DnsRecord` now preserves and sends the referenced `DnsZone.projectId` during record read, upsert, and delete operations, avoiding ambiguous same-name DNS zones across projects.
- `FlexibleIp` now deletes a just-created IP if the initial post-create reverse
  DNS update fails, avoiding untracked allocated IPs when Scaleway rejects the
  reverse value.
- `Domain` now retries repeated transient Scaleway custom-domain deployment
  errors by deleting the failed custom domain and recreating it within a bounded
  retry loop.
- The production smoke stack now sets the nginx container port explicitly so
  custom-domain HTTP-01 validation reaches the container correctly.

## [0.1.4-beta.51] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `Instance.cloudInit` writes multi-line Scaleway `cloud-init` user data before
  first boot. The script may be a `string` or `Redacted<string>`, is not returned
  in resource attributes, and is tracked by a SHA-256 hash for replacement diffing.
- The production smoke test now covers Instance cloud-init and exposes stable
  smoke rerun controls through `SCW_SMOKE_RUN_ID`, `SCW_SMOKE_STAGE`, and
  `SCW_SMOKE_PREFIX`.

### Fixed

- `Instance` deletion now uses Scaleway's terminate action and deletes Alchemy-created
  `sbs_volume` Block Storage volumes after they are detached, while preserving
  explicitly attached volume IDs.
- `Instance` creation now follows Scaleway's REST lifecycle for first-boot user data:
  create the stopped server, set `cloud-init` user data, then power on when requested.
- `PrivateNic` no longer treats Scaleway auto-assigned IPAM IP IDs as drift unless
  `ipamIpIds` is explicitly configured.
- Scaleway validation errors now include per-argument details when the API returns
  them.

## [0.1.3-beta.51] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `Vpc` provisions Scaleway VPCs and supports one-way routing and custom route
  propagation enablement.
- `PrivateNetwork` provisions Scaleway Private Networks with optional VPC binding,
  subnet membership, DHCP enablement, and default route propagation.
- `VpcAcl` manages the complete VPC ACL rule set for one VPC/IP version and resets
  that rule set to accept-all on delete.
- `VpcRoute` provisions Scaleway VPC routes with resource, Private Network, or VPC
  connector next hops.
- `VpcConnector` provisions Scaleway VPC connectors between two VPCs.
- `Instance` provisions Scaleway Instance virtual machines with conservative
  replacement for image, commercial type, and volume identity changes.
- `SecurityGroup` provisions Scaleway Instance security groups and owns their full
  rule set.
- `FlexibleIp` provisions Scaleway Instance flexible IP reservations with tag,
  reverse DNS, and server attachment updates.
- `PrivateNic` provisions Scaleway Instance private NIC attachments to Private
  Networks.

### Fixed

- Private Network subnet add/delete requests now use Scaleway's documented batch
  payload shape (`{ subnets: [...] }`).
- VPC ACL rule port fields now use Scaleway's published `src_port_*` and
  `dst_port_*` names.
- The production smoke test now deploys, updates, settles, and destroys a public
  `Alchemy.Stack` through the documented Alchemy CLI workflow.
- Namespace reconciliation waits for Scaleway readiness after create/update.
- Container create/update retries Scaleway transient state errors.
- Instance deletion now powers off servers and detaches managed flexible IPs before
  delete; Instance image aliases are preserved in outputs to avoid alias drift.
- `FlexibleIp` normalizes nullable Scaleway fields to `undefined` in outputs.
- `PrivateNic` preserves stable server and Private Network identity when Scaleway
  omits those fields from responses.
- `SecurityGroup` ignores Scaleway-managed non-editable rules when comparing and
  returning the owned rule set.

### Known limitations

- Scaleway documents in-place Private Network subnet add/delete endpoints, and the
  provider calls them during subnet drift reconciliation. The production smoke
  account currently receives `501 unimplemented endpoint` for those endpoints in
  `fr-par`, so live smoke omits `PrivateNetwork.subnets` until those endpoints are
  available.

## [0.1.2-beta.51] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Pin `@effect/vitest` to `4.0.0-beta.74` in the install command so root installs
  with `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.51` stay on the Effect beta.74 line.

## [0.1.1-beta.51] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `ContainerProps.domains` can now bind custom domains as part of the container
  workflow while keeping standalone `Domain` available for explicit control.
- `ContainerProps.crons` can now create cron triggers as part of the container
  workflow while keeping standalone `Trigger` available for explicit control.
- `RegistryNamespace` provisions Scaleway Container Registry namespaces and returns
  the registry endpoint plus an `imagePrefix` for container image names.
- `Secret` provisions Scaleway Secret Manager secrets and value versions. Secret
  values are accepted as `Redacted<string>` and are never returned in outputs.
- `ContainerProps.secretEnvironmentVariables` now accepts `Redacted<string>` values
  and unwraps them only at the Scaleway API boundary.
- `smoke:scaleway` now performs an opt-in live smoke test for Containers namespace,
  Container readiness, Registry namespace, Secret Manager secret/version, and Object
  Storage bucket creation/deletion.

### Known limitations

- Current Alchemy v2 beta resource options do not include `alwaysUpdate` or an
  equivalent read-on-noop hook. Same-props deploys cannot detect external deletion
  of `Container`-managed companion domains/triggers; those companions are verified
  when a read/update path runs. Revisit this when Alchemy exposes such an option.

### Changed

- The npm package is now scoped, with package
  metadata and release workflow support for public npm org publishing.
- `publishConfig` and the release workflow now publish the scoped npm package with
  public access.

### Fixed

- Generated `Container` physical names now respect Scaleway's 34-character name
  limit, and explicit overlong container names fail locally before API calls.

- Migrated the Serverless Containers integration from the `v1beta1` API to the
  generally-available `v1` API (`/containers/v1/...`). The public resource props were
  refactored to v1-native names and semantics (no backward-compatible aliasing):
  - Container `Create`/`Update` now auto-deploy; the separate deploy call was removed.
  - `ContainerProps` renames: `registryImage` → `image`, `memoryLimit` (MiB) →
    `memoryLimitBytes`, `cpuLimit` → `mvcpuLimit`, `timeout` is now a duration string
    (e.g. `"300s"`), `maxConcurrency` → `scalingOption` (with
    `concurrentRequestsThreshold`/`cpuUsageThreshold`/`memoryUsageThreshold`), and the
    `httpOption` enum → `httpsConnectionsOnly` boolean. The `ContainerHttpOption` type
    was removed and `ContainerScalingOption` added. The `Container` attribute
    `registryImage` is now `image` and `domainName` is now `publicEndpoint`.
  - The `Cron` resource was renamed to `Trigger` (resource type `Scaleway.Trigger`,
    attribute `triggerId`), backed by the v1 `/triggers` route. It now supports every
    v1 trigger source via a discriminated `source` union:
    - `{ type: "cron", schedule, timezone?, body?, headers? }`
    - `{ type: "sqs", queueUrl, accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, region?, endpoint? }`
    - `{ type: "nats", serverUrls, subject, credentialsFileContent? }`

    Plus an optional `destination` (`{ httpPath?, httpMethod? }`) and `description`.
    Write-only secrets (`secretAccessKey`, `credentialsFileContent`) are sent on
    create/update and never read back. New exported types: `TriggerSource`,
    `CronTriggerSource`, `SqsTriggerSource`, `NatsTriggerSource`, `TriggerDestination`,
    `TriggerSourceType`, `TriggerHttpMethod`.

  - `Domain` derives its `url` from the hostname (v1 no longer returns `url`).

- The in-memory test mock now returns flat (non-enveloped) Containers responses to
  match the real v1 API, and serves `/triggers` instead of `/crons`.

### Removed

- Unused `listCrons`/`listDomains` client methods.

## [0.1.0-beta.51] - Initial private beta

Tested against `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.51`.

### Added

- Scaleway resource providers: `Namespace`, `Container`, `Cron` (later renamed
  `Trigger`), `Domain`, and `Bucket`.
- `Scaleway.providers()` layer bundling every provider, the `ScalewayAuth` registration, and credential resolution.
- Tagged `ScalewayError` wrapping Scaleway API and Object Storage failures.
- `resolveFromEnv()` and `resolveFromStored(creds)` helpers for credential tests.
